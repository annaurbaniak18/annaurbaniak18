## About me

Hi, my name is Anna Urbaniak, I am a beginner manual tester, here I would like to show you my projects and the knowledge I have. I am a communicative, thorough, committed person and I have a great willingness to learn and develop myself. My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills.
I am an IT technician by profession. I completed postgraduate studies in Computer Network Administration.
In my spare time, I take part in tests on the uTest platform and learn about new tools to support tests.
Learn on your own using Udemy's courses, tutorials, and webinars and marathons on IT, testing and
development. I am also learning the basics of Java and JavaScript to expand my automated testing skills in the future.

# Tools used in testing:
  * Chrome Dev Tools
